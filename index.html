                    The Eastern and Southern Africa Region (ESAR) Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Technical Working Group (TWG) was established in March 2020 as one of four TWGs to to enhance regional partner coordination on operational and strategic planning,
                    monitoring and evaluation as well as the support to countries on particular aspects of the preparedness and response to COVID-19. The Terms of Reference were revised in February 2022 to encompass RCCE partner coordination for public
                    health emergencies (PHE) with regional implications. The RCCE TWG is co-chaired by UNICEF and IFRC with operational and technical support from the RCCE Collective Service for day to day management and follow up of TWG activities and
                    actions. There are two subworking groups linked to the RCCE TWG-the Community Feedback SWG and the Media Taskforce. Membership and participation is open to all partners operating at regional level involved in RCCE response to address
                    PHE. The RCCE TWG meets on the fourth Wednesday of the month between 11:00am and 12:30pm EAT.
